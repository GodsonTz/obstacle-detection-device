# obstacle-detection-device
A low-cost embedded systems project designed to detect obstacles and assist users with safe navigation in real-world environments.

# project overview
This project focuses on designing of  a low-cost obstacle detection device using embedded systems. The device is intended to assist users by detecting nearby obstacles and give an alert(vibrations) to improve navigation in everyday environments.

# problem statement
Challenging environments hinder navigation especially for individuals with visual limitations therefore there is a need for a simple and affordable assistive solutions that can improve safety. 

# system components
• Microcontroller: ESP32

• Distance sensor: HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor

• Alert unit:vibration motor

• Power supply: 5v battery

# how it works
• Sensor emits ultrasonic pulses

• Microcontroller reads the data

• Vibration motor gives feedback based on specific vibration patterns
